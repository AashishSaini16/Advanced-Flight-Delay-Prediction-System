# Advanced-Flight-Delay-Prediction-System
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for developing a neural network model to predict flight delays using historical aviation data. The project uses SHAP for interpretability, and an interactive widget for real-time predictions, demonstrating preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready insights.
